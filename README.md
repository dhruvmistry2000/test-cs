##  Overview

Dhruvmistry is an open-source project designed to streamline the deployment and management of web applications using Docker containers. It addresses several key problems in the development process, including:

1. **Portability**: By leveraging Docker, developers can easily deploy their applications across different environments, such as local development, staging, and production servers.

2. **Consistency**: With Docker, all components of a web application are packaged together into a single container, ensuring that they are consistent and reproducible across different systems.

3. **Scalability**: Docker containers can be easily scaled up or down to meet changing demand, making it easier to handle increased traffic or user growth.

4. **Security**: By using Docker, developers can manage dependencies more effectively and ensure that their applications are secure by isolating them from the host system.

The project offers several key features and benefits:
**Dockerfile Support**: Developers can use a Dockerfile to automate the build process of their web application, ensuring consistency across different environments.
**Automated Deployment**: The `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` workflow automates the deployment of Docker images to Docker Hub when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
**Code Organization**: The project's CSS architecture ensures that all styles are organized and consistent, making it easier for developers to maintain and update the website or application.

The target audience for Dhruvmistry is web developers who want to streamline their deployment process and ensure consistency across different environments. It provides a robust solution for managing Docker containers and automating the deployment of web applications using GitHub Actions.

                <td>- To improve the performance of the provided JavaScript code, we can optimize the `ssViewAnimate` function by reducing the number of animations and using a more efficient approach to stagger them<br>- Here's an optimized version:

```javascript
const ssViewAnimate = function() {
    const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.view-animate');
    let currentElementIndex = 0;

    function animateNextElement() {
        if (currentElementIndex < elements.length) {
            const element = elements[currentElementIndex];
            const delay = currentElementIndex * 400; // Adjust the delay based on your needs

            setTimeout(() => {
                element.style.opacity = '1';
                element.style.transform = 'translateY(0)';
                currentElementIndex++;
                animateNextElement();
            }, delay);
        }
    }

    animateNextElement();
};
```

### Explanation:
1<br>- **Selecting Elements**: We select all elements with the class `view-animate` using `document.querySelectorAll`.
2<br>- **Current Element Index**: We initialize a variable `currentElementIndex` to keep track of which element to animate next.
3<br>- **Staggered Animation**: The `animateNextElement` function is called recursively to animate each element in sequence.
4<br>- **Delay Calculation**: For each element, we calculate the delay based on its index<br>- This helps in creating a smooth transition between elements.
5<br>- **Animation Steps**:
   - Set the opacity of the current element to 1.
   - Translate the element vertically to its original position.
   - Increment the `currentElementIndex` and call `animateNextElement` again.

This approach reduces the number of animations and improves the performance by ensuring that each animation is executed smoothly.</td>
